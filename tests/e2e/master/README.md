## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
# Start the dev server (required for tests)
npm run dev:safe
```

The development server must be running on `http://localhost:5000` before running tests.

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure `.env` file is configured with Supabase credentials:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

## Running Tests

### Run All Master Data Tests
```bash
# Run all tests in master directory
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master

# Run with UI mode (interactive)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master --ui

# Run with headed browser (see browser actions)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master --headed
```

### Run Individual Test Files
```bash
# Items tests only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master/items.spec.ts

# Companies tests only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master/companies.spec.ts

# BOM tests only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master/bom.spec.ts
```

### Run Specific Test Cases
```bash
# Run tests matching pattern
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master/items.spec.ts -g "페이지 로드"

# Run single test by name
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master/companies.spec.ts -g "자동 거래처 코드"
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with debugging
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master/items.spec.ts --debug

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master --project=chromium
npx playwright test tests/e2e/master --project=mobile-chrome
```

## Test Reports

### View HTML Report
```bash
# After tests complete, view report
npx playwright show-report
```

Reports are generated in `playwright-report/` directory.

### JSON Results
Test results are also saved in:
- `test-results/results.json` - JSON format
- `test-results/junit.xml` - JUnit format (for CI/CD)

## Test Data

### Important Notes
- Each test creates unique test data using `Date.now()` timestamps
- Tests are designed to be independent and idempotent
- Soft deletes are used (items marked `is_active: false`)
- Korean text is tested throughout (UTF-8 encoding validation)

### Test Data Cleanup
Tests create records like:
- Items: `TEST-{timestamp}`
- Companies: `테스트거래처_{timestamp}`
- BOMs: Uses existing items for relationships

These can be cleaned up from the database if needed:
```sql
-- Clean up test items
DELETE FROM items WHERE item_code LIKE 'TEST-%';

-- Clean up test companies
DELETE FROM companies WHERE company_name LIKE '테스트거래처_%';
```

## Test Coverage

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npx playwright test tests/e2e/master
        env:
          NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}
          NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}

      - name: Upload test report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Server Not Running
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:5000
```
**Solution**: Start dev server with `npm run dev:safe`

#### 2. Timeout Errors
```
Error: Timeout 10000ms exceeded
```
**Solution**:
- Increase timeout in test: `{ timeout: 30000 }`
- Check if Supabase connection is working
- Verify network speed

#### 3. Korean Text Garbled
```
Expected "부품" but got "ë¶€í'ˆ"
```
**Solution**:
- Verify `locale: 'ko-KR'` in `playwright.config.ts`
- Check API routes use `request.text()` + `JSON.parse()` pattern

#### 4. Selector Not Found
```
Error: locator.click: Target closed
```
**Solution**:
- Add `await page.waitForSelector()` before interaction
- Increase `waitForTimeout` values
- Check if element is dynamically loaded

### Debug Tips

1. **Use Playwright Inspector**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --debug
   ```

2. **Take Screenshots**:
   ```typescript
   await page.screenshot({ path: 'debug.png' });
   ```

3. **Console Logs**:
   ```typescript
   page.on('console', msg => console.log(msg.text()));
   ```

4. **Network Requests**:
   ```typescript
   page.on('request', request => console.log(request.url()));
   page.on('response', response => console.log(response.status()));
   ```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Metrics (on localhost)
- **Page Load**: < 3 seconds
- **Table Render**: < 1 second
- **Search/Filter**: < 500ms
- **Modal Open**: < 300ms
- **Form Submit**: < 2 seconds

### Actual Results (Sample)
- Items page load: ~1.2s
- Companies page load: ~1.1s
- BOM page load: ~1.5s

## Best Practices

1. **Always wait for network idle**:
   ```typescript
   await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
   ```

2. **Use unique test data**:
   ```typescript
   const uniqueId = Date.now();
   ```

3. **Clean up after tests**:
   ```typescript
   test.afterEach(async ({ page }) => {
     // Cleanup logic
   });
   ```

4. **Handle Korean text properly**:
   ```typescript
   expect(inputValue).toBe('한글');
   ```

5. **Test both happy and error paths**:
   ```typescript
   // Test validation errors
   // Test success scenarios
   ```

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow existing test structure
2. Use descriptive test names in Korean
3. Add comments for complex interactions
4. Test both desktop and mobile views
5. Include Korean text validation
6. Add performance metrics
