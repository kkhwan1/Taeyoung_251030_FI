## Data Quality Issues Identified

### Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)
1. **BOM Table Integrity** - 130 records (100%) have undefined/null fields
   - ALL BOM records need investigation
   - Likely data import/migration issue
   - Recommendation: Delete invalid records and re-import

### High Priority Issues
2. **Item Prices** - 292 records (40.2%) have NULL/zero prices
   - Impacts financial calculations

   - Recommendation: Set default value "미지정" (Unspecified)

### Good News
- ✅ No duplicate item codes
- ✅ All items have required fields (code, name)
- ✅ All companies data is complete and valid
- ✅ All 1,000 inventory transactions are valid
