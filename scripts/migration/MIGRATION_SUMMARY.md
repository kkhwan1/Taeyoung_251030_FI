# 태창 ERP - Data Cleanup & Import Migration Summary

## 실행 일시
- **Date**: 2025-10-30
- **Project ID**: pybjnkbmtlyaftuiieyq
- **Environment**: Production (Supabase Cloud)

## 실행 결과

### Phase 1: Data Cleanup ✅
**Duration**: ~1s

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Deleted all BOM records: 130 → 0
- ✅ Cleaned up items with zero/null prices: 292 records
- ✅ Removed "NaN" strings from spec and material fields

**Results**:
```
BOM records: 0 (cleaned)
Items with NULL price: 246
```

### Phase 2: Update Prices ✅
**Duration**: ~20s

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Loaded 243 price records from price-master.json
- ✅ Updated 229 items with latest prices
- ⚠️ 14 items not found in database

**Results**:
```
Items updated: 229
Items not found: 14
Items with price > 0: 480 (66.1%)
```

**Not Found Items** (14):
These item codes from price-master.json don't exist in the items table:
- Items need to be created first before prices can be assigned
- Recommendation: Review and create missing items if needed

### Phase 3: Import Comprehensive Items ✅
**Duration**: ~10s

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Loaded 34 comprehensive items from comprehensive-items.json
- ✅ Verified all items against existing database
- ✅ No duplicates created

**Results**:
```
New items: 0
Duplicates (already exist): 30
Skipped (no item code): 4
```

**Analysis**:
- All 30 valid items already exist in database
- 4 records skipped due to missing item codes (null 품번 fields)
- No import needed - database is up to date

### Phase 4: Validation ✅
**Duration**: ~5s

**Database Status**:
```
Total items: 726
Items with price: 480 (66.1%)
BOM records: 0 (cleaned)
Inbound transactions: 0 (not imported yet)
Total transactions: 1,788
```

**Data Quality Metrics**:
```
Price Coverage: 66.1%
Spec Coverage: 29.5%
Material Coverage: 17.9%
Supplier Coverage: 0.0%
Active Items: 100.0%
```

**Category Distribution**:
```
부자재: 615 items (84.7%)
원자재: 109 items (15.0%)
제품: 2 items (0.3%)
```

## Overall Summary

### Achievements ✅
1. ✅ **BOM Table Cleaned**: 130 invalid records removed
2. ✅ **Prices Updated**: 229 items received latest pricing
3. ✅ **Data Verified**: All comprehensive items confirmed in database
4. ✅ **Quality Validated**: Database integrity verified

### Key Metrics
- **Total Duration**: ~36 seconds
- **Items Processed**: 726 items
- **Prices Updated**: 229 items (31.5% of total)
- **Data Quality**: 66.1% price coverage

### Outstanding Items ⏳

1. **Inbound Transactions** (Priority: High)
   - Status: Not imported yet
   - Required Files: inbound-2025-01.json through inbound-2025-04.json (231 records)
   - Impact: Inventory calculations incomplete without transaction history

2. **BOM Relationships** (Priority: Medium)
   - Status: Table cleaned, relationships not configured
   - Required: Valid BOM data with proper parent-child relationships
   - Impact: Cannot track product components and manufacturing

3. **Missing Item Codes** (Priority: Low)
   - Status: 14 items in price-master.json don't exist in items table
   - Action: Review and create missing items if needed
   - Impact: Some prices not applied

4. **Supplier Mapping** (Priority: Medium)
   - Status: 0% supplier coverage
   - Required: Map supplier names to companies table
   - Impact: Cannot track supplier relationships and pricing history

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Import Inbound Transactions**
   - Create inbound-*.json files from Excel data
   - Run import script to populate inventory_transactions table
   - Verify stock calculations

2. **Review Missing Items**
   - Investigate 14 missing item codes
   - Create items if they are valid parts
   - Re-run price update for new items

### Short-term Actions (1-2 weeks)
1. **BOM Configuration**
   - Clean and validate BOM data
   - Import valid BOM relationships
   - Test product manufacturing calculations

2. **Supplier Mapping**
   - Match supplier names from price-master to companies table
   - Create supplier records if missing
   - Link items to suppliers

### Long-term Actions (1 month+)
1. **Data Quality Improvement**
   - Increase spec coverage from 29.5% to 80%+
   - Add material information for more items
   - Complete supplier relationships

2. **Historical Data**
   - Import historical transactions (pre-2025)
   - Build pricing history
   - Establish baseline metrics

## Validation Checklist

- [x] BOM table is empty (0 records)
- [x] No "NaN" strings in database
- [x] Price coverage > 60%
- [x] All comprehensive items exist
- [x] No duplicate items created

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Review Results in UI
```bash
npm run dev:safe
# Open http://localhost:5000/items
# Verify prices and item data
```

### Step 2: Prepare Inbound Transactions
```bash
# Create inbound transaction JSON files
# Format: { transaction_date, item_code, quantity, unit_price, ... }
```

### Step 3: Import Transactions
```bash
node scripts/migration/phase5-import-inbound.js
# (Script to be created when files are ready)
```

### Step 4: Configure BOM
```bash
# Clean BOM data
# Import valid relationships
# Test manufacturing calculations
```
