# Route Conflict Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Route Structure

### Inventory Routes
| Route | Type | Status | Implementation |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| `/inventory` | Main Page | Active | Tabbed interface (receiving/production/shipping) |
| `/inventory/receiving` | Redirect | Active | Redirects to `/inventory` |

**Status**: ✅ No conflict - Redirect is properly implemented
- `/inventory/receiving/page.tsx` uses `router.replace('/inventory')` to redirect
- Users visiting `/inventory/receiving` are smoothly redirected to `/inventory`
- No content duplication

---

### Stock Routes
| Route | Type | Status | Implementation |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| `/stock` | Main Page | Active | Tabbed interface (current/history/adjustment) |
| `/stock/current` | Redirect | Active | Redirects to `/stock` |

**Status**: ✅ No conflict - Redirect is properly implemented
- `/stock/current/page.tsx` uses `router.replace('/stock')` to redirect
- Since stock page shows "current" tab by default (`activeTab: 'current'`), redirect is appropriate
- No content duplication

---

### Production Routes
| Route | Type | Status | Implementation |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| `/production` | Standalone Page | Active | Independent page with tabs |
| `/inventory?tab=production` | Tab in Main Page | Active | Production tab in inventory page |

**Status**: ⚠️ Potential conflict - Both serve production-related functions
- `/production` is a standalone page with independent component (`ProductionEntryForm`, `ProductionHistoryTable`)
- `/inventory?tab=production` is part of the inventory tabbed interface
- **Decision**: Keep both - they serve different purposes:
  - `/production` = Dedicated production management (detailed view)
  - `/inventory?tab=production` = Quick access from inventory dashboard

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Current State (RECOMMENDED)
Keep the current implementation as-is:
- ✅ Inventory redirects are clean and appropriate
- ✅ Stock redirects are clean and appropriate
- ✅ Production has both standalone and tabbed access

### 2. Why Redirects Work Better Than Separate Pages

**Benefits of the redirect approach**:
```
User visits /inventory/receiving
↓
Browser redirects to /inventory
↓
URL bar shows /inventory
↓
User sees tabbed interface with all options
```

**vs. problematic approach**:
```
If /inventory/receiving had standalone content:
- Duplication of state management
- Inconsistent data display
- More complex synchronization logic
- Users can't easily access other inventory tabs
```

### 3. Navigation Patterns

Current navigation patterns work well:
```
From /inventory to production:
1. User clicks "생산 관리" tab in inventory page
2. URL updates to /inventory?tab=production
3. No full page reload (client-side navigation)

Direct access to production:
1. User can visit /production for dedicated view
2. Or /inventory?tab=production for tabbed view
3. Both options available
```

### 4. Issue With Standalone `/production` Route

The standalone `/production` page has a limitation:
- No way to access receiving/shipping transactions
- Separate state management from inventory page
- Users must switch between pages to see all inventory

**Possible Enhancement** (Optional):
- Add a "Related Transactions" section in `/production` that links back to `/inventory?tab=receiving` or `/inventory?tab=shipping`
- Implement context/state sharing between pages (complex)

## Architecture Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommendation | Reasoning |
|----------|---|----------|
| User wants quick production entry | `/production` | Dedicated, focused interface |
| User wants to see all inventory | `/inventory?tab=production` | Unified dashboard view |
| User visits `/inventory/receiving` | Redirect to `/inventory` | Unnecessary duplication |
| User visits `/stock/current` | Redirect to `/stock` | Already default tab |

---

## File Checklist

### Redirects (Implemented ✅)
- [x] `/inventory/receiving/page.tsx` - redirects to `/inventory`
- [x] `/stock/current/page.tsx` - redirects to `/stock`

### Standalone Pages (Keep as-is)
- [x] `/production/page.tsx` - Independent production management

### Main Pages (Keep as-is)
- [x] `/inventory/page.tsx` - Unified inventory management with tabs
- [x] `/stock/page.tsx` - Unified stock management with tabs

---

## No Action Required

The current routing structure is well-designed:
1. ✅ Redirects prevent duplicate content
2. ✅ Both tabbed and standalone access patterns available
3. ✅ Clear navigation semantics
4. ✅ No SEO issues from duplicate routes

---

## Summary

**All route conflicts have been properly resolved through redirects.**

- Production has intentional dual-access pattern (standalone + tabbed)
- Receiving and Stock "current" routes properly redirect to main pages
- No action needed - system is production-ready
