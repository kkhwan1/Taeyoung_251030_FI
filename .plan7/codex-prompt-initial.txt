Analyze FITaeYoungERP architecture and provide detailed recommendations:

## Current Architecture State

### Data Fetching Patterns
- 73 manual fetch patterns using useState + useEffect
- TanStack Query configured but completely unused (0 occurrences of useQuery)
- No caching strategy implemented
- Potential race conditions in parallel requests

### API Route Structure
- 128 API routes with significant duplication
- Inconsistent error handling across routes
- No unified response format
- Code duplication in validation and normalization

### State Management
- Heavy reliance on local useState (90+ components)
- Only 3 Context providers (FontSize, Theme, Toast)
- Props drilling in deep component trees
- No global state management library

### Performance Issues
- force-dynamic on ALL pages (no SSG/ISR)
- 500KB bundle size with unused code
- Legacy code: transactionManager.ts (1,617 lines), query-optimizer.ts (748 lines)
- Only 4 components use lazy loading out of 90+

### Code Quality
- React Strict Mode disabled
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Multiple Supabase client creation patterns
- Unused MCP integration (TanStack Query provider exists but unused)

## Analysis Required

For each area above, provide:

1. **Severity Assessment** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
2. **Root Cause Analysis** - Why these issues exist
3. **Impact Assessment** - How it affects performance, maintainability, security
4. **Specific Recommendations** - Concrete steps to fix each issue
5. **Implementation Priority** - Which to fix first and why
6. **Risk Evaluation** - Risks of fixing vs not fixing

## Expected Output Format

Please structure your analysis as:

### 1. Data Fetching Architecture
- Severity: [Level]
- Root Cause: [Analysis]
- Impact: [Performance/Memory/UX impacts]
- Recommendations: [Specific fixes]
- Priority: [1-5, 1=highest]
- Risks: [What could go wrong]

[Repeat for all 6 areas]

### Implementation Sequence
Based on your analysis, provide an optimal sequence for addressing these issues, considering:
- Dependencies between fixes
- Risk mitigation
- Performance impact
- Development effort

### Critical Warnings
Highlight any issues that could cause production failures if not addressed.

Please be thorough and specific in your analysis.
